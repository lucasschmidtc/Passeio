// This class is used as a temporary storage for the CLLocations emitted by the CoreLocationManager. Once a recording
// is stopped its CLLocations are used to create a new track or to add a new segment to an existing one. Besides
// being a temporary storage, it also ensures that the CLLocations are valid (captured after the recording started;
// not a cached location) and that they are sorted (ascending order in relation to the time).
